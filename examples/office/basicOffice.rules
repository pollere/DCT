// Trust schema for office example (ACM ICN 2021 Tutorial)
// illustrating non-fine-grained security

// Each application process in this trust domain has a role cert

// trust anchor name for this trust zone
_domain:    "office"

// Publication definition.
// Use of mbps shim means publications have mId, sCnt, mts (set by mbps) and
// at least one leading component to identify the domain. Between those
// components, at least one more component followed by others as needed
// This basic version doesn't put any fine-grained restrictions on who can
// say what to whom (as in office.trust) but just enforces that publications
// must be signed by valide roleCerts.

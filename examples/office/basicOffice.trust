// Publication definition.
// Use of mbps shim means publications have mId, sCnt, mts (set by mbps) and
// at least one leading component to identify the network. Between those
// components, at least one more component followed by others as needed
// This basic version doesn't put any fine-grained restrictions on who can
// say what to whom (as in office.trust) but just enforces that publications
// must be signed by valide roleCerts.

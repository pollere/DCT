/*
 * room.cpp: room controller application for Office example for ICN2021 tutorial
 *
 * This application uses mbps shim. Message body (if any) is packaged
 * in int8_t vectors to pass between application and mbps. Parameters
 * are passed to mpbs in an vector of pairs (msgParms) and passed from mbps
 * to the application in a mbpsMsg structure that contains an unordered_map
 * where values are indexed by the tags (components of Names) that are
 * defined in the trust schema for this particular application.
 *
 * room models a raspPi-like computer that controls settings of attached
 * devices for its assigned room (temperature, light, lock, screen)
 * For the Office example, application settable parameters are:
 *
 * func - the particular accessory device: light, door, screen, temp
 * topic - the type of message: command or status
 * args - the action to perform for command or the state for status
 *
 * A room controller waits for a command, prints it (simulated action),
 * then publishes this new status

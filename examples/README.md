# Examples

These directories are included to illustrate how DCT can be used and to perhaps spark new ideas. Real solutions use similar approaches.

- hmIot: The README in this directory may be useful in understanding how DCT's modules can be used.

- office: another example, originally developed for a tutorial at the 2021 ACM ICN conference

- lpubpriv: very simple location-based example to illustrate publisher privacy signature managers.

- relay: directory for relays and usage examples

Writing trust schemas in VerSec's language and creating identity bundles can be somewhat tedious, but both of these appear amenable to automation.

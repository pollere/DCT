// Home IoT Message-Based Pub/Sub relay unicast ("remote") trust schema

// Each process has an identity associated with a particular type of
// certificate that is signed and validatable.
// This can be used with one of the iot[0-2].trust schemas where this
// gets used for the relay's "remote" transport and the iot[0-2].trust
// will be used for the "home" multicast DeftT  of the relay.
// This uses AEAD so that external packets would be encrypted

// trust anchor name associated with this domain
_domain:    "iot"

// MBPS Publication definition
// target, topic, topicArgs are set using application parameters
// msgID, sCnt, mts get set in mbps.hpp (the MBPS "shim") for a particular message
// In addition, all trust schemas for mbps-based applications must include a #chainInfo
// which lists all the signing chain tags so schemaLib can access them
// A particular application process can make its subscription more
// specific by using a subscription list with specific subcollection (designated
// by targets) and related callback functions.

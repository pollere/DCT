Experiment with dist_tdvc

Set m_virtClk to true in dct_model.hpp (line 70).

Meshed configurations can be tested by setting MESHTEST at compile time
(see Makefiles). The options are either two overlapping sets of members
or all the members sorted into a line.

The relay and ptps files can handle its use.

dist_tdvc.hpp has a method, publishCalibrate() which is called before a
member starts calibrating and at the end of each round. It's format is:
    <prefix>/cal/<role>/<id>/<neighborhood_size>/<vcTimestamp>

The tdvcgraf script can be run on dctwatch output to pull out the "cal"
publications logged by dist_tdvc. It sorts them into groups by their ids
with lines that extract the dctwatch time and the amount of difference
between dctwatch time and the publication's (vc) timestamp.
This format can be input to graf.

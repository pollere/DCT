Roadmap (or hopeful to-do list)

1. Better integration of TCP
    - certs
    - specification in rules files
    - make sure ONLY validated client can use up the tcp port
    = fill transmission "pipe"
2. Streamline distributors
    - templatize
    - improve how they get set up in dct_model
3. Visibility of parameters that might be changed for different environments
    - collect in a text note
    - collect for ease of setting
4. Update documentation (ugh)
5. VerSec improvements
6. Evaluate whether IBLT advances can be useful for syncps
7. Home Assistant integration
8. Implement trusted guest/worker framework
